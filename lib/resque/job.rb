module Resque
  # A Resque::Job represents a unit of work. Each job lives on a
  # single queue and has an associated payload object. The payload
  # is a hash with two attributes: `class` and `args`. The `class` is
  # the name of the Ruby class which should be used to run the
  # job. The `args` are an array of arguments which should be passed
  # to the Ruby class's `perform` class-level method.
  #
  # You can manually run a job using this code:
  #
  #   job = Resque::Job.reserve(:high)
  #   klass = Resque::Job.constantize(job.payload['class'])
  #   klass.perform(*job.payload['args'])
  class Job
    include Helpers
    extend Helpers

    # Raise Resque::Job::DontPerform from a before_perform hook to
    # abort the job.
    DontPerform = Class.new(StandardError)

    # The worker object which is currently processing this job.
    attr_accessor :worker

    # The name of the queue from which this job was pulled (or is to be
    # placed)
    attr_reader :queue

    # This job's associated payload object.
    attr_reader :payload

      @payload = payload
    end

    # Creates a job by placing it on a queue. Expects a string queue
    # name, a string class name, and an optional array of arguments to
    # pass to the class' `perform` method.
    #
    # Raises an exception if no queue or class is given.

    # Removes a job from a queue. Expects a string queue name, a
    # string class name, and, optionally, args.
    #
    # Returns the number of jobs destroyed.

    # If no args are provided, it will remove all jobs of the class
    # provided.
    #
    # That is, for these two jobs:
    #
    # { 'class' => 'UpdateGraph', 'args' => ['defunkt'] }
    # { 'class' => 'UpdateGraph', 'args' => ['mojombo'] }
    #
    # The following call will remove both:
    #
    #   Resque::Job.destroy(queue, 'UpdateGraph')
    #
    # Whereas specifying args will only remove the 2nd job:
    #
    #   Resque::Job.destroy(queue, 'UpdateGraph', 'mojombo')
    #
    # This method can be potentially very slow and memory intensive,
    # depending on the size of your queue, as it loads all jobs into
    # a Ruby array before processing.
